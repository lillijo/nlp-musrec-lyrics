## Notebook
If you want to run this notebook to look at the results or try to train the model yourself, 
please write me a message and I will provide you with the cleaned data

## Back
This has only been used for testing the demo tool.
If you want to try the demo tool, either uncomment the extra actions in the `back/nlp/views.py` file (you might have to also somewhat adjust them, as it was a quick and dirty thing)
or contact me to obtain the small database of songs, genres and words

Once the db is filled, you can start the server with
`python manage.py runserver`

## Front
This is a prototypical very simplified tool for recommending music.
Run `npm install` and start it with `npm start`
